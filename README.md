#HOW TO SET UP

	1. The only file I have edited in a standard wordpress instance is the function.php file in the theme. To install and test, simply install a wordpress instance, or use an existing one, replace the function.php file with the provided one for brand new install, or copy the last section of from this file and paste it into the function.php file for existing instance. 
	2. Create db.json file and put in dummy data from https://ffxblue.github.io/interview-tests/test/wordpress-categories/ . Set up json server with https://github.com/typicode/json-server .
	
	Result can be seen from Settings-General tab of Dashboard. Please scroll to the bottom.

#MY THOUGHT
	
	The coding part is easy, however since restriction is minimal, how to approave the task and how to display result with best outcome is very challenging.

#TIME SPENT

	5 hours. 3 on thinking and researching, 1 on code and 1 on testing and documenting.
